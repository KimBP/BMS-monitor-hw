This repository contains a Kicad project defining the HW for the
bms-monitor project.


Version v2.0 is a prototype made for an esp32s3_devkitc with 9 or 10  modules 
between the two pin rows.

The display to use is a 3.5" TFT LCD shield based on a ILI9488 controller
with SPI.
Furthermore the display has an xpt2046 touch controller. Also SPI


TO CHANGE in next version:

- Diodes to make power possible both via NMEA connector and a separate power
  supply at the same time

- Buffer on 5V to 3V pins (CAN buffer to ESP32)

- Pullup on touch MISO
