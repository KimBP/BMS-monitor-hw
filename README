This repository contains a Kicad project defining the HW for the
bms-monitor project.


Version v1.0 is the prototype made for an esp32s3_devkitc with 9 modules 
between the two pin rows. This variant seems to be the one with micro USB
connectors.

The display to use is the open-smart 3.8" TFT LCD Shield based on ILI 9488
